### Hi there, my name is JoÃ£o Paulo Gotardi Begiato, but you can call me JP ðŸ‘‹

## About me.

I'm natural from Jundiai - SP (Brazil) lover of series (:tv), games (:video_game:), anime & manga (:hotsprings:), comics (:books:), cats(:cat:) and dogs (:dog:). I am married to an incredible woman who supports me in every aspect of my life.

## Career

I'm a chemical engineer but I'm in a career transition to web development, so I participated in a bootcamp at Resilia EducaÃ§Ã£o, where in addition to learning hardskills I was also able to develop softskills.
